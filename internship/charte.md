# Internship
Congratulations, you have been accepted to start your internship with osscameroon.
And it is an honnour for us to have you with us.

We will spend the next 3-6 months together and there are certain rules that you need observe
to make your internship smooth and enjoyable.

## Behave

**1- Interpersonal**
- Be humble
- Be nice
- Be a team player (no blame culture the team is responsible for the success or failure of the project)

**2- Research**

- If you get stuck, first **ASK GOOGLE**
- If you are stuck because of an error message, please read the error message than, **ASK Google**
- If you don't find the answer on google or struggle to understand it:
	- First ask to your team mate, or fellow intern in the internship group
	- Then ask in the osscameroon group
	- If nothing helps then you can come and bother one of us ;)
- You can ask us direct questions, if you feel that we are the only people who can have the answer,
  A good example can be if you want clarifications about the specifications of a project,
  Or How we do something at **osscameroon**, or you need some access

**Don't be lazy!**

**3- Ask questions, please do**

You can't know everything and we are here to help, just keep in mind that you should have
made your own research first, before coming to us.

When you ask a question please, seriously please just don't come and say.
**"It does'nt work!"**

First we don't know what **"it"** is and what you did.

So make sure you provide some context, tell us what you where doing before you faced that issue,
send us maybe a snippet of the command or code you ran,
a screenshot.
Then tell us how you tried to fix the issue (in case you did try), or share with us the error message.

This will make us very happy and we will give you a lot of **cookies**. :)

4- Listen and learn

When you ask us questions make sure you tried to understand what you are doing, apply it and test the suggestion,
keep the answer somewhere to avoid having to ask the same questions over and over again.

5- English

Please communicate in english, exclusively in English on GitHub no exception will be tolerated.
